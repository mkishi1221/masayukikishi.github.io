		<h1 style="text-align: center;"><br>Hi! I do startups, product design and natural language processing.</h1>
		<p style="text-align: center;"><br>Systems that reach out to form relationships have always fascinated me. Whether it is furniture, architecture, art, or a piece of software, I find that there is beauty in experiences that are well thought out. They have encouraged me to create solutions that demonstrate a deep understanding of their roles in our everyday lives. As a result, my work has a strong emphasis on Design for Meaning.</p>
		<p style="text-align: center;"><br>I regularly help fellow entrepreneurs with their businesses. Feel free to drop me a message to say hi!</p>
