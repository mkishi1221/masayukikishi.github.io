## Amutri UI/UX design
​
**Amutri is a technology startup specializing in automated architectural visualisation. Their cutting-edge solution reduces the skill level required as well as time and cost of creating 3D Visualisations.**
​
This project involves designing the UI/UX for an advanced 3D visualization software, with a focus on intuitive navigation, community-led virtual experiences and reducing the barrier for entry for 3D visualisation. The solution attempts to deliver a user-friendly interface that allows seamless exploration and interaction with 3D environments. User testing and feedback was incorporated to iterate and refine the design. 

The goal was to create a visually captivating and immersive experience that empowers users, setting new standards in 3D visualization software. This design was developed into the MMP for Amutri which was used to engage with investors and enterprise customers.
