## Efflorescence
â€‹
**How can we encourage families to spend more time together? Can we design products that encourage more social interaction to improve our mental health? How can we strengthen our relationships?**

This project took special interest in the experience of sharing meals together. Individual pots could be taken care by different family members and friends; arranging multiple pots together creates a pattern that resembles flower blossoms. The composition attempts to express the special moment of sharing meals with friends and family. Herbs can emphasize the freshness of the food prepared and can greatly improve appetite by adding color and aroma. It can also uplift the presentation, making each meal time a bit of a special occasion.


Each pot has a built-in magnet that can help attach it to a magnetic surface such as fridge doors. The form allows it to be tilted at an angle for easy access to the herbs when attached to a vertical surface. Multiple pots can be used to create a vertical garden.  The hole above the magnet allows the pot to be hung on a kitchen utensil rail behind the counter or hung from the ceiling next to a well-lit window. The soil compartment can also drain excess water to be stored below and is made accessible for easy maintenance.
